/*
Problem statement: Students may take 0 to any number of tests in the semester.
Program should do the following:
1. Data input to get all test scores (assume all tests out of 100)
2. Sum up all tests
3. Find real average value (Floating point)
4. Find a rounded average value (whole number)
5. Assign a semester grade based on rounded average value
6. Print all data.
Sentinel condition: test score cannot be negative. So data entry stops with negative test 
score (impossible value or sentinel value for test score is entered)
